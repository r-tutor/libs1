<h2>The Automobile Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the &lsquo;Automobile&rsquo; data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(imports85)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>imports85</code> is a data frame with 205 cases (rows) and 26
variables (columns).  This data set consists of three types of
entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various
characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its
normalized losses in use as compared to other cars.  The second rating
corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its
price indicates.  Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol
associated with its price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this
symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians
call this process &lsquo;symboling&rsquo;.  A value of +3 indicates that the auto
is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
</p>
<p>The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured
vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a
particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,
sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car
per year.
