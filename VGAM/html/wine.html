<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set comes from Randall (1989) and concerns a factorial
experiment for investigating factors that affect the bitterness of white
wines. There are two factors in the experiment: temperature at the time
of crushing the grapes and contact of the juice with the skin.
Two bottles of wine were fermented for each of the treatment combinations.
A panel of 9 judges were selected and trained for the ability to
detect bitterness.
Thus there were 72 bottles in total.
Originally, the bitterness of the wine were taken on a continuous
scale in the interval from 0 (none) to 100 (intense)
but later they were
grouped using equal lengths into five ordered categories 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
