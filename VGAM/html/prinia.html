<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The yellow-bellied Prinia <em>Prinia flaviventris</em>
is a common bird species located in Southeast Asia. A
capture&ndash;recapture experiment was conducted at the Mai Po
Nature Reserve in Hong Kong during 1991, where captured
individuals had their wing lengths measured and fat index
recorded. A total of 19 weekly capture occasions were
considered, where 151 distinct birds were captured.
</p>
<p>More generally, the prinias are a genus of small
insectivorous birds, and are sometimes referred to as
<em>wren-warblers</em>.  They are a little-known group of the
tropical and subtropical Old World, the roughly 30 species
being divided fairly equally between Africa and Asia.

<pre>
head(prinia)
summary(prinia)
rowSums(prinia[, c("cap", "noncap")])  # 19s

#  Fit a positive-binomial distribution (M.h) to the data:
fit1 &lt;- vglm(cbind(cap, noncap) ~ length + fat, posbinomial, data = prinia)

#  Fit another positive-binomial distribution (M.h) to the data:
#  The response input is suitable for posbernoulli.*-type functions.
