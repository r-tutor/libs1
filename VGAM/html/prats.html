<h2> Pregnant Rats Toxological Experiment Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A small toxological experiment data.
The subjects are fetuses from
two randomized groups of pregnant rats,
and they were given a placebo or chemical treatment.
The number with birth defects were recorded, as well
as each litter size.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data concerns a toxological experiment where
the subjects are fetuses from
two randomized groups of 16 pregnant rats each,
and they were given a placebo or chemical treatment.
The number with birth defects andn the litter size were recorded.
Half the rats were fed a control diet during pregnancy and
lactation, and the diet of the other half was treated with a
chemical. For each litter the number of pups alive at 4 days
and the number of pups that survived the 21 day lactation period,
were recorded.
