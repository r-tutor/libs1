</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>species</code></dt><dd><p>Number of species. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ofreq</code></dt><dd><p>Observed frequency of individual

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the early 1940s Corbet spent two years trapping butterflies
in Malaya. Of interest was the total number of species.
Some species were so rare (e.g., 118 species had only
one specimen) that it was thought likely that there were
many unknown species.
