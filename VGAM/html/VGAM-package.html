<h2>
Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models
and Associated Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">VGAM</span> provides functions for fitting vector generalized
linear and additive models (VGLMs and VGAMs), and associated
models (Reduced-rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Reduced-rank
VGAMs). This package fits many models and distributions by
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE.  Also fits
constrained ordination models in ecology such as constrained
quadratic ordination (CQO).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package centers on the
<em>iteratively reweighted least squares</em> (IRLS)
algorithm.
Other key words include
Fisher scoring,
additive models,
reduced-rank regression,
penalized likelihood,
and constrained ordination.
The central modelling functions are
<code><a href="vglm.html">vglm</a></code>,
<code><a href="vgam.html">vgam</a></code>,
<code><a href="rrvglm.html">rrvglm</a></code>,
<code><a href="grc.html">rcim</a></code>,
<code><a href="cqo.html">cqo</a></code>,
<code><a href="cao.html">cao</a></code>.
Function
<code><a href="vglm.html">vglm</a></code>
operates very similarly to
<code><a href="../../stats/html/glm.html">glm</a></code> but is much more general,
and many methods functions
such as <code><a href="coefvlm.html">coef</a></code> and
<code><a href="predictvglm.html">predict</a></code>
are available.
The package uses S4 (see <code><a href="../../methods/html/methods-package.html">methods-package</a></code>).
A companion package called <span class="pkg">VGAMdata</span> contains some larger
data sets which were shifted from <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>.
</p>
<p>Compared to other similar packages, such as
<span class="pkg">gamlss</span> and
<span class="pkg">mgcv</span>,
<span class="pkg">VGAM</span> has more models implemented (150+ of them) and they
are not restricted to
a location-scale-shape framework or
(largely) the 1-parameter exponential family.
There is a general statistical framework behind it all,
that once grasped, makes regression modelling quite unified.
Some features of the package are:
(i) most family functions handle multiple responses;
(ii) reduced-rank regression is available by operating
on latent variables (optimal linear combinations of the
explanatory variables);
(iii) basic
automatic smoothing parameter selection is implemented for VGAMs,
although it has to be refined;
(iv) <em>smart</em> prediction allows correct prediction of nested
terms in the formula provided smart functions are used.
</p>
<p>The GLM and GAM classes are special cases of VGLMs and VGAMs.
The VGLM/VGAM framework is intended to be very general
so that it encompasses as many distributions and models as
possible. VGLMs are limited only by the assumption that the
regression coefficients enter through a set of linear predictors.
The VGLM class is very large and encompasses a wide range of
multivariate response types and models, e.g., it includes
univariate and multivariate distributions,
categorical data analysis,
extreme values,
correlated binary data,
quantile and expectile regression,
time series
problems.
Potentially, it can handle
generalized estimating equations,
survival analysis,
bioassay data and
nonlinear least-squares
problems.
</p>
<p>Crudely, VGAMs are to VGLMs what GAMs are to GLMs.
Two types of VGAMs are implemented:
1st-generation VGAMs with <code><a href="s.html">s</a></code> use vector backfitting,
while
2nd-generation VGAMs with <code><a href="sm.os.html">sm.os</a></code> and
<code><a href="sm.ps.html">sm.ps</a></code> use O-splines and P-splines,
do not use the backfitting algorithm,
and have automatic smoothing parameter selection.
The former is older and is based on Yee and Wild (1996).
The latter is more modern
(Yee, Somchit and Wild, 2018)
but it requires a reasonably large number of observations
to work well.
</p>
<p>This package is the first to check for the <em>Hauck-Donner effect</em>
(HDE) in regression models; see <code><a href="hdeff.html">hdeff</a></code>.  This is an
aberration of the Wald statistics when the parameter estimates are too
close to the boundary of the parameter space.  When present the p-value
of a regression coefficient is biased upwards so that a highly
significant variable might be deemed nonsignificant.  Thus the HDE can
create havoc for variable selection!
</p>
<p>Somewhat related to the previous paragraph, hypothesis testing
using the likelihood ratio test,
Rao's score test (Lagrange multiplier test) and
(modified) Wald's test are all available; see <code><a href="summaryvglm.html">summaryvglm</a></code>.
For all regression coefficients of a model, taken one at a time,
all three methods require further IRLS iterations to obtain
new values of the other regression coefficients after one
of the coefficients has had its value set (usually to 0).
Hence the computation load is overall significant.

<p>For a complete list of this package, use <code>library(help = "VGAM")</code>.
New <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions are continually being written and
added to the package.

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>This package is undergoing continual development and improvement,
therefore users should treat everything as subject to change.
This includes the
family function names,
argument names,
many of the internals,
the use of link functions,
and slot names.
For example, all link functions may be renamed so that they
end in <code>"link"</code>,
e.g., <code>loglink()</code> instead of <code>loge()</code>.
Some future pain can be avoided by using good programming
techniques, e.g., using extractor/accessor functions such as
<code>coef()</code>, <code>weights()</code>, <code>vcov()</code>,
<code>predict()</code>.
Nevertheless, please expect changes in all aspects of the package.
See the <code>NEWS</code> file for a list of changes from version to
version.
