<h2> Control Function for vglm() </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Algorithmic constants and parameters for running <code>vglm</code> are set
using this function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
vglm.control(checkwz = TRUE, Check.rank = TRUE, Check.cm.rank = TRUE,
             criterion = names(.min.criterion.VGAM),
             epsilon = 1e-07, half.stepsizing = TRUE,
             maxit = 30, noWarning = FALSE,
             stepsize = 1, save.weights = FALSE,
             trace = FALSE, wzepsilon = .Machine$double.eps^0.75,
             xij = NULL, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>checkwz</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating whether the diagonal elements
of the working weight matrices should be checked
whether they are sufficiently positive, i.e., greater
than <code>wzepsilon</code>. If not, any values less than
<code>wzepsilon</code> are replaced with this value.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Check.rank</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating whether the rank of the VLM matrix
should be checked. If this is not of full column rank then
the results are not to be trusted.
The default is to give an error message if the VLM
matrix is not of full column rank.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Check.cm.rank</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating whether the rank of each constraint matrix
should be checked. If this is not of full column rank then
an error will occur. Under no circumstances should any
constraint matrix have a rank less than the number of columns.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>criterion</code></td>
<td>

<p>character variable describing what criterion is to be
used to test for convergence. The possibilities are
listed in <code>.min.criterion.VGAM</code>, but most family
functions only implement a few of these.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>epsilon</code></td>
<td>

<p>positive convergence tolerance epsilon. Roughly speaking,
the Newton-Raphson/Fisher-scoring iterations are assumed
to have converged when two successive <code>criterion</code>
values are within <code>epsilon</code> of each other.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>half.stepsizing</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating if half-stepsizing is allowed. For
example, in maximizing a log-likelihood, if the next
iteration has a log-likelihood that is less than
the current value of the log-likelihood, then a half
step will be taken.  If the log-likelihood is still
less than at the current position, a quarter-step
will be taken etc. Eventually a step will be taken
so that an improvement is made to the convergence
criterion.  <code>half.stepsizing</code> is ignored if
<code>criterion == "coefficients"</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maxit</code></td>
<td>

<p>maximum number of (usually Fisher-scoring) iterations
allowed.  Sometimes Newton-Raphson is used.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>noWarning</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating whether to suppress a warning if
convergence is not obtained within <code>maxit</code> iterations.
This is ignored if <code>maxit = 1</code> is set.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>stepsize</code></td>
<td>

<p>usual step size to be taken between each
Newton-Raphson/Fisher-scoring iteration. It should be a
value between 0 and 1, where a value of unity corresponds
to an ordinary step.  A value of 0.5 means half-steps are
taken.  Setting a value near zero will cause convergence
to be generally slow but may help increase the chances
of successful convergence for some family functions.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>save.weights</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating whether the <code>weights</code> slot of a
<code>"vglm"</code> object will be saved on the object. If not,
it will be reconstructed when needed, e.g., <code>summary</code>.
Some family functions have <code>save.weights = TRUE</code> and
others have <code>save.weights = FALSE</code> in their control
functions.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical indicating if output should be produced for each
iteration.  Setting <code>trace = TRUE</code> is recommended in
general because <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> fits a very broad variety of
models and distributions, and for some of them, convergence
is intrinsically more difficult. Monitoring convergence
can help check that the solution is reasonable or that
a problem has occurred.  It may suggest better initial
values are needed, the making of invalid assumptions,
or that the model is inappropriate for the data, etc.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>wzepsilon</code></td>
<td>

<p>small positive number used to test whether the diagonals
of the working weight matrices are sufficiently positive.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xij</code></td>
<td>

<p>A formula or a list of formulas.
Each formula has a RHS giving <i>M</i> terms making up a
covariate-dependent term (whose name is the response).
That is, it creates a variable
that takes on different values for each linear/additive predictor,
e.g., the ocular pressure of each eye.
The <i>M</i> terms must be unique;
use <code><a href="fill.html">fill1</a></code>, <code>fill2</code>, <code>fill3</code>, etc. if necessary.
Each formula should have a response which is taken as the
name of that variable, and the <i>M</i> terms are enumerated
in sequential order.  Each of the <i>M</i> terms multiply
each successive row of the constraint matrix.
When <code>xij</code> is used, the use of <code>form2</code> is also required
to give <em>every</em> term used by the model.
</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="Select.html">Select</a></code> can be used to
select variables beginning with the same character string.
</p>
</td></tr>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>other parameters that may be picked up from control
functions that are specific to the <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Most of the control parameters are used within
<code>vglm.fit</code> and you will have to look at that to
understand the full details.
</p>
<p>Setting <code>save.weights = FALSE</code> is useful for some
models because the <code>weights</code> slot of the object
is the largest and so less memory is used to store the
object. However, for some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function,
it is necessary to set <code>save.weights = TRUE</code> because
the <code>weights</code> slot cannot be reconstructed later.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with components matching the input names. A little error
checking is done, but not much.
The list is assigned to the <code>control</code> slot of
<code>vglm</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>For some applications the default convergence criterion should
be tightened.
Setting something like <code>criterion = "coef", epsilon = 1e-09</code>
is one way to achieve this, and also add
<code>trace = TRUE</code> to monitor the convergence.
Setting  <code>maxit</code> to some higher number is usually not
needed, and needing to do so suggests something is wrong, e.g.,
an ill-conditioned model, over-fitting or under-fitting.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Reiterating from above,
setting <code>trace = TRUE</code> is recommended in general.
</p>
<p>In Example 2 below there are two covariates that have
linear/additive predictor specific values.  These are
handled using the <code>xij</code> argument.
