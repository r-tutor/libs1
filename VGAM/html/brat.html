<h2> Bradley Terry Model </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a Bradley Terry model (intercept-only model) by maximum
likelihood estimation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
brat(refgp = "last", refvalue = 1, ialpha = 1)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>refgp</code></td>
<td>

<p>Integer whose value must be from the set
{1,...,<i>M+1</i>}, where there are <i>M+1</i>
competitors. The default value indicates the last
competitor is used&mdash;but don't input a character string,
in general.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>refvalue</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric. A positive value for the reference group.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ialpha</code></td>
<td>

<p>Initial values for the <i>alpha</i>s.
These are recycled to the appropriate length.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Bradley Terry model involves <i>M+1</i> competitors
who either win or lose against each other (no draws/ties
allowed in this implementation&ndash;see <code><a href="bratt.html">bratt</a></code>
if there are ties). The probability that Competitor
<i>i</i> beats Competitor <i>j</i> is <i>alpha_i / (alpha_i + alpha_j)</i>,
where all the <i>alpha</i>s are positive.
Loosely, the <i>alpha</i>s can be thought of as
the competitors' &lsquo;abilities&rsquo;. For identifiability, one
of the <i>alpha_i</i> is set to a known value
<code>refvalue</code>, e.g., 1. By default, this function
chooses the last competitor to have this reference value.
The data can be represented in the form of a <i>M+1</i>
by <i>M+1</i> matrix of counts, where winners are the
rows and losers are the columns. However, this is not
the way the data should be inputted (see below).
</p>
<p>Excluding the reference value/group, this function
chooses <i>log(alpha_j)</i> as the
<i>M</i> linear predictors. The log link ensures that
the <i>alpha</i>s are positive.
</p>
<p>The Bradley Terry model can be fitted by logistic
regression, but this approach is not taken here.
The Bradley Terry model can be fitted with covariates,
e.g., a home advantage variable, but unfortunately, this
lies outside the VGLM theoretical framework and therefore
cannot be handled with this code.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"vglmff"</code> (see <code><a href="vglmff-class.html">vglmff-class</a></code>).
The object is used by modelling functions such as <code><a href="vglm.html">vglm</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>Presently, the residuals are wrong, and the prior weights
are not handled correctly. Ideally, the total number of
counts should be the prior weights, after the response has
been converted to proportions. This would make it similar
to family functions such as <code><a href="multinomial.html">multinomial</a></code>
and <code><a href="binomialff.html">binomialff</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function <code><a href="bratUC.html">Brat</a></code> is useful for coercing
a <i>M+1</i> by <i>M+1</i> matrix of counts into a one-row
matrix suitable for <code>brat</code>. Diagonal elements are
skipped, and the usual S order of <code>c(a.matrix)</code>
of elements is used. There should be no missing values
apart from the diagonal elements of the square matrix.
The matrix should have winners as the rows, and losers
as the columns. In general, the response should be a
1-row matrix with <i>M(M+1)</i> columns.
</p>
<p>Only an intercept model is recommended with <code>brat</code>.
It doesn't make sense really to include covariates because
of the limited VGLM framework.
</p>
<p>Notationally, note that the <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function
<code><a href="brat.html">brat</a></code> has <i>M+1</i> contestants, while
<code>bratt</code> has <i>M</i> contestants.
