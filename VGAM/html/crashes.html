<p>For crashes,
<code>chrashi</code> are the number of injuries by car,
<code>crashf</code>  are the number of fatalities by car
(not included in <code>chrashi</code>),
<code>crashtr</code> are the number of crashes involving trucks,
<code>crashmc</code> are the number of crashes involving motorcyclists,
<code>crashbc</code> are the number of crashes involving bicycles,
and
<code>crashp</code>  are the number of crashes involving pedestrians.
For alcohol-related offences,
