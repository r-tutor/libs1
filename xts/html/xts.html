<h2> Create Or Test For An xts Time-Series Object </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructor function for creating an extensible time-series object.
</p>
<p><code>xts</code> is used to create an <code>xts</code> object from raw data inputs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xts(x = NULL,
    order.by = index(x),
    frequency = NULL,
    unique = TRUE,
    tzone = Sys.getenv("TZ"),
    ...)

is.xts(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> an object containing the time series data </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order.by</code></td>
<td>
<p> a corresponding vector of unique times/dates - must be
of a known time-based class. See details. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>frequency</code></td>
<td>
<p> numeric indicating frequency of <code>order.by</code>. See details. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>unique</code></td>
<td>
<p> should index be checked for unique time-stamps? </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tzone</code></td>
<td>
<p> time zone of series.  This is ignored for Date indices </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p> additional attributes to be added. See details. </p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An <code>xts</code> object extends the S3 class <code>zoo</code> from the package of the
same name.
</p>
<p>Similar to zoo objects, xts objects must have an ordered index.  While zoo
indexes cannot contain duplicate values, xts objects have optionally supported
duplicate index elements since version 0.5-0.  The <code>xts</code> class has one
additional requirement, the index must be a time-based class.  Currently
supported classes include: &lsquo;Date&rsquo;, &lsquo;POSIXct&rsquo;, &lsquo;timeDate&rsquo;,
as well as &lsquo;yearmon&rsquo; and &lsquo;yearqtr&rsquo; where the index values
remain unique.
</p>
<p>The uniqueness requirement was relaxed in version 0.5-0, but is still enforced
by default.  Setting <code>unique = FALSE</code> skips the uniqueness check and only
ensures that the index is ordered via the <code>isOrdered</code> function.
</p>
<p>As of version 0.10-0, xts no longer allows missing values in the index.  This
is because many xts functions expect all index values to be finite.  The most
important of these is <code>merge.xts</code>, which is used ubiquitously.  Missing
values in the index are usually the result of a date-time conversion error (e.g.
incorrect format, non-existent time due to daylight saving time, etc).  Because
of how non-finite numbers are represented, a missing timestamp will always be
at the end of the index (except if it is <code>-Inf</code>, which will be first).
</p>
<p>Another difference is that the object may now carry additional
attributes that may be desired in individual time-series handling.
This includes the ability to augment the objects data with
meta-data otherwise not cleanly attachable to a standard zoo object.
</p>
<p>Examples of usage from finance may include the addition of data
for keeping track of sources, last-update times, financial
instrument descriptions or details, etc.
</p>
<p>The idea behind <code>xts</code> is to offer the user the ability to utilize
a standard zoo object, while providing an mechanism to customize
the object's meta-data, as well as create custom methods to handle
the object in a manner required by the user.
</p>
<p>Many xts-sepcific methods have been written to better handle the
unique aspects of xts.  These include, &lsquo;&quot;[&quot;&rsquo;, merge, cbind,
rbind, c, Ops, lag, diff, coredata, head and tail.  Additionally
there are xts specific methods for converting amongst R's different
time-series classes. 
</p>
<p>Subsetting via &quot;[&quot; methods offers the ability to specify dates by
range, if they are enclosed in quotes.  The style borrows from
python by creating ranges with a double colon &ldquo;&quot;::&quot;&rdquo; or &ldquo;&quot;/&quot;&rdquo; operator.  Each side of
the operator may be left blank, which would then default to the beginning
and end of the data, respectively.  To specify a subset of times,
it is only required that the time specified be in standard ISO format, with
some form of separation between the elements. The time must be &lsquo;left-filled&rsquo;,
that is to specify a full year one needs only to provide the year, a month would require
the full year and the integer of the month requested - e.g. '1999-01'.
This format would extend all the way down to seconds - e.g. '1999-01-01 08:35:23'.
Leading zeros are not necessary.  See the examples for more detail.
</p>
<p>Users may also extend the <code>xts</code> class to new classes to
allow for method overloading.
</p>
<p>Additional benefits derive from the use of <code>as.xts</code> and
<code>reclass</code>, which allow for lossless two-way conversion
between common R time-series classes and the <code>xts</code> object
structure. See those functions for more detail. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class <code>xts</code>. As it inherits and extends
the zoo class, all zoo methods remain valid.  Additional
attributes may be assigned and extracted via
<code>xtsAttributes</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

 
<p>Most users will benefit the most by using the
<code>as.xts</code> and <code>reclass</code> functions to
automagically handle <em>all</em> data objects
as one would handle a <code>zoo</code> object.
